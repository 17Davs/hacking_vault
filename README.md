# Hacking Vault 📚

Welcome to my little corner of ethical hacking and security notes! This is a messy but growing stash where I jot down tools, techniques, and commands (for when I forget stuff!). I’m still figuring it out, but it’s packed with things I find handy. Feel free to peek and maybe learn something! 😄

## What’s Inside? 🔍
This repo is my personal notebook from my ethical hacking and security learning journey. You’ll find notes on:
- **Tools**: Like Metasploit, Wireshark, and more.
- **Techniques**: From exploitation to privilege escalation.
- **Commands**: Handy snippets I don’t want to lose track of.
- **And More**: Cryptography, vulnerabilities, and web security.

It’s organized into folders to (try to) keep the chaos in check—check out the [structure](#folder-structure) below!

## Folder Structure 📂
- **Attachments**: Random images and files I’ve collected.
- **Buffer Overflow**: Notes on memory exploits.
- **Cryptography**: Encryption, hashes, and key exchanges.
- **Exploitation**: Brute forcing, Metasploit, and SQL injection.
- **Networking**: tcpdump, Wireshark, and network commands.
- **OSINT**: Password spraying, email discovery, and more.
- **Password Cracking**: Hashcat, John the Ripper, and file crackers.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Linux and Windows techniques.
- **Scripting**: Bash scripting basics.
- **Shells**: Bind, reverse, web shells, and payloads.
- **Tools & Management**: Gobuster, linPEAS, and CLI notes.
- **Vulnerabilities**: CVE details and scan methods.
- **Web & Application Security**: Burp Suite, security headers, and subdomain enum.

*Note: It’s a work in progress—some folders might be sparse as I add more!*
