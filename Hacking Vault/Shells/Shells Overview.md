# 🌐 Shells Overview

## 📋 What is a Shell?

A **shell** is software that allows interaction with an operating system, typically via a command-line interface (CLI). In cybersecurity, it refers to a session an attacker uses to run commands on a compromised system.

## 🔍 Purpose in Cybersecurity

Shells enable attackers to perform various malicious activities:

- **Remote System Control**: Execute commands or software remotely.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gain higher access (e.g., administrative privileges).
- **Data Exfiltration**: Access and steal sensitive data.
- **Persistence**: Create backdoors or accounts for future access.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Deploy malware, create hidden accounts, or delete data.
- **Network Pivoting**: Use the compromised system to access other network targets.

## ✅ Quick Notes

- Shells can be graphical but are typically CLI-based, depending on the OS.
- Types (e.g., bind, reverse, web shells) vary in setup and detection risk.
- Shells are critical for initial access and lateral movement in attacks.
