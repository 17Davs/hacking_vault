Automated hash recognition tools such as [hashID](https://pypi.org/project/hashID/ "https://pypi.org/project/hashID/") exist but are unreliable for many formats. For hashes that have a prefix, the tools are reliable. Use a healthy combination of context and tools. If you find the hash in a web application database, it’s more likely to be MD5 than NTLM (NT LAN Manager). Automated hash recognition tools often get these hash types mixed up, highlighting the importance of learning yourself.

### Linux Passwords

On Linux, password hashes are stored in `/etc/shadow`, which is normally only readable by root. They used to be stored in `/etc/passwd`, which was readable by everyone.

The `shadow` file contains the password information. Each line contains nine fields, separated by colons (`:`). The first two fields are the login name and the encrypted password. More information about the other fields can be found by executing `man 5 shadow` on a Linux system.

The encrypted password field contains the hashed passphrase with four components: prefix (algorithm id), options (parameters), salt, and hash. It is saved in the format `$prefix$options$salt$hash`. The prefix makes it easy to recognise Unix and Linux-style passwords; it specifies the hashing algorithm used to generate the hash.

Here’s a quick table of some of the most common Unix-style password prefixes you might encounter. They are listed in the order of decreasing strength. You can read more about them by checking the man page with `man 5 crypt`.

|Prefix|Algorithm|
|---|---|
|`$y$`|yescrypt is a scalable hashing scheme and is the default and recommended choice in new systems|
|`$gy$`|gost-yescrypt uses the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function and the yescrypt hashing method|
|`$7$`|scrypt is a password-based key derivation function|
|`$2b$`, `$2y$`, `$2a$`, `$2x$`|bcrypt is a hash based on the Blowfish block cipher originally developed for OpenBSD but supported on a recent version of FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris 10 and newer, and several Linux distributions|
|`$6$`|sha512crypt is a hash based on SHA-2 with 512-bit output originally developed for GNU libc and commonly used on (older) Linux systems|
|`$md5`|SunMD5 is a hash based on the MD5 algorithm originally developed for Solaris|
|`$1$`|md5crypt is a hash based on the MD5 algorithm originally developed for FreeBSD|
