Authentication hashes are the hashed versions of passwords stored by operating systems; it is sometimes possible to crack them using our brute-force methods. To get your hands on these hashes, you must often already be a privileged user, so we will explain some of the hashes we plan on cracking as we attempt them.

## NTHash / NTLM

NThash is the hash format modern Windows operating system machines use to store user and service passwords. It’s also commonly referred to as NTLM, which references the previous version of Windows format for hashing passwords known as LM, thus NT/LM.

In Windows, SAM (Security Account Manager) is used to store user account information, including usernames and hashed passwords. You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, using a tool like Mimikatz, or using the Active Directory database: `NTDS.dit`. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation, as you can often conduct a “pass the hash” attack instead, but sometimes, hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy.
