Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a domain. Can lead to discovering more potential points of vulnerability.

# OSINT

## SSL/TLS Certificates
Basically, when a SSL/TLS certificate is created, a "Certificate Transparency(CT) logs" - publicly accessible logs of every SSL/TLS certificate created for a domain name - takes part. We can use resources like https://crt.sh to discover subdomains belonging to a domain.

## Search Engines (Google Dorking)
Usage of advanced searching methods like 
```site:*.domain.com -site:www.domain.com ```
for more specific results, in this case excluding the www.domain.com (likelly to be already known).

## Sublist3r
Automated method using tools like Sublist3r to discover new subdomains. Usage example: ``
``` bash
sublist3r.py -d acmeitsupport.thm  
  
          ____        _     _ _     _   _____  
         / ___| _   _| |__ | (_)___| |_|___ / _ __  
         \___ \| | | | '_ \| | / __| __| |_ \| '__|  
          ___) | |_| | |_) | | \__ \ |_ ___) | |  
         |____/ \__,_|_.__/|_|_|___/\__|____/|_|

# DNS Bruteforce
Bruteforce DNS is the, usually automated, method that involves trying a lot of different possible subdomains based on pre-defined worlists (common ones). 
Example: ````dnsrecon -t brt -d acmeitsupport.thm
