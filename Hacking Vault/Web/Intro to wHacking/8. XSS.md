Cross-Site Scriptinng is an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a webapp and executed.
# XSS Payloads



# Reflected XSS
this type of XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.

Once you've found some data which is being reflected in the web application, you'll then need to confirm that you can successfully run your JavaScript payload; your payload will be dependent on where in the application your code is reflected

# Stored XSS
this type happens when the XSS payload is stored in the web application (commonly its database) in the way that it then runs on every users that tries to access or interact with the site or web page where it is triggered.
