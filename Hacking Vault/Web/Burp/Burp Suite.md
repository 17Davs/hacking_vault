## **3. Basic Burp Suite Components**

| Component    | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Proxy**    | Intercepts HTTP/S traffic between the browser and the target site. |
| **Scanner**  | Scans for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.            |
| **Spider**   | Crawls the target site to discover hidden endpoints.               |
| **Intruder** | Automates attacks such as brute-forcing and fuzzing.               |
| **Repeater** | Sends individual requests repeatedly, useful for testing.          |
| **Decoder**  | Decodes and encodes data in different formats (e.g., Base64, URL). |
| **Comparer** | Compares two pieces of data to highlight differences.              |

## **4. Using Burp Suite for Web Application Testing**

### **Setting Up Burp Proxy**

1. **Configure your browser** to use Burp Suite as a proxy (default is `127.0.0.1:8080`).
2. In Burp, go to the **Proxy** tab and enable **Intercept**.
3. Your browser traffic will be captured in Burp, allowing you to modify requests and responses.

### **Crawling the Target**

- Go to the **Spider** tab and enter the target URL.
- Click **Start Spider** to crawl the website, automatically identifying links and endpoints.

### **Scanning for Vulnerabilities**

- Use the **Scanner** to automatically scan the target for vulnerabilities.
- Right-click a request in the **Proxy** tab and select **Scan**.

### **Brute-Forcing with Intruder**

- Use **Intruder** for brute-force attacks (e.g., guessing passwords).
- Select a request and click **Send to Intruder**, then configure payloads and attack options.

## **5. Burp Intruder**

**Note:**Â When assigning numbers in the "Payload Set" dropdown for multiple positions, follow a top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
#### Attack Types Summary 
- **Sniper**:
    - **Default** and most common.    
    - **Cycles through one payload set**, testing **each payload  into each positions one at a time**.
    - Ideal for **focused testing**, checking **each parameter individually**.
        
- **Battering Ram**:
    - Sends the **same payload to all positions simultaneously**.
    - Useful for **race conditions** or when **inputs must match**.
        
- **Pitchfork**:
    - Uses **different payloads for each position**, in **parallel**.
    - Good for testing **distinct parameters independently**.
        
- **Cluster Bomb**:
    - Tests **every combination** of **all payloads in all positions**.
    - Ideal for **comprehensive multi-input testing**.


## **5. Burp Suite's Community vs Professional Versions**

| Feature      | Community Version | Professional Version |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **Scanner**  | No                | Yes                  |
| **Intruder** | Limited           | Full access          |
| **Spider**   | Limited           | Full access          |
| **Price**    | Free              | Paid (with a trial)  |

## **7. Final Notes**

- **Burp Suite** is a powerful tool for web application security testing, essential for ethical hackers.
- Use the **Proxy** to intercept and modify HTTP/S traffic.
- The **Community version** is a good starting point, but the **Professional version** offers more advanced scanning and functionality for in-depth testing.
